Augur-SPDX
=======

Augur-SPDX is designed as a library for use with the Augur project to perform software license scanning, and the data it produces is displayed in the "Risk" section of the Augur Frontend. Data is stored in the Postgresql `SPDX` schema of Augur, with a mapping table between how Augur-SPDX represents repositories and how Augur represents repositories in the `augur_data` schema. 


Augur-SPDX is a command-line tool for managing SPDX documents and data. It can scan source code distributions to produce SPDX information, store that information in a relational database, and extract it in a plain-text format on request.

The discovery and presentation of software package license information is a complex problem facing organizations that rely on open source software within their 
innovation streams. Augur-SPDX enables creation of an SPDX document for any  software package to represent associated license information. In addition, Augur-SPDX 
can be used in the creation and continuous maintenance of an inventory of all  open-source software used in an organization. The primary audience for Augur-SPDX is open source software teams seeking to advance the representation and maintenance of open source  software package license information. 

[SPDX](http://www.spdx.org) is a standard format for communicating information about the contents of a software package, including license and copyright information. Augur-SPDX supports the SPDX standard.

Dependencies
------------
- Python 3.6
- PostgreSQL 8.x or later version (can be on a separate machine)
- All Python dependencies are handled automatically by `pip`.

Installation
------------

### Step 1 - Download and install

To install tha latest `master` version of Augur-SPDX, use the Makefile in Augur:

    $ make install-spdx

#### Alternate Install

You can also Install augur-spdx manually.

We recommend doing this inside a Python [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/), but it
is not a requirement. In much the same way that its not a requirement to avoid serving peanuts to somebody with a peanut allergy. Use a virtual environment. The easiest way to set one up is to install `virtualenv` for your operating system, then run `virtualenv --python=python3 <location of virtualenv>. After that, you activate it by typing `source <path to virtualenv>/bin/activate`. When you want to deactivate the virtualenv, type `deactivate`. 

This installation can be achieved through the Makefile in the augur-sbom directory.

    $ sudo make install

If you have any problems installing Nomos, run the install script individually:

    $ ./DoSOCSv2-0.x.x/scripts/install-nomos.sh

Usage: Command Line Tool
-----

The simplest use case is scanning a package, generating a
document, and printing an SPDX document in one shot:

    $ dosocs2 oneshot package.tar.gz
    dosocs2: package.tar.gz: package_id: 1
    dosocs2: running nomos on package 1
    dosocs2: package.tar.gz: document_id: 1
    [... document output here ...]

Also works on directories:

    $ dosocs2 oneshot ./path/to/directory

The scan results and other collected metadata are saved in the database
so that subsequent document generations will be much faster.

To just scan a package and store its information in the database:

    $ dosocs2 scan package.tar.gz
    dosocs2: package_tar_gz: package_id: 456
    dosocs2: running nomos on package 456

In the default configuration, if a scanner is not specified, only `nomos`
is run by default. It gathers license information, but is a bit slow.
One can use the `-s` option to explicitly specify which scanners to run:

    $ dosocs2 scan -s nomos_deep,dummy package.tar.gz
    dosocs2: package_tar_gz: package_id: 456
    dosocs2: running nomos_deep on package 456
    dosocs2: running dummy on package 456

After `dosocs2 scan`, no SPDX document has yet been created.
To create one in the database (specifying the package ID):

    $ dosocs2 generate 456
    dosocs2: (package_id 456): document_id: 123

Then, to compile and output the document in tag-value format:

    $ dosocs2 print 123
    [... document output here ...]

Use `dosocs2 --help` to get the full help text. The `doc` directory
here also provides more detailed information about how `dosocs2` works
and how to use it.

Usage: Augur Worker

NOTE: This method is experimental <br />
NOTE: Make sure you are using Python3 with a virtualenv

Augur Includes many extra tools that help automate the work of Augur-SPDX.<br />
Right now, the best way to run augur-SPDX is to use Augur's extra built-in tools.<br />
Augur-SPDX will work with some files in augur and take some steps in order.

Here is the process that Augur-SPDX uses:

1. Find all repositories in the Augur database<br />
2. Scan each stored repository with the Augur-SPDX command-line tool<br />
3. Generate SPDX Documents for each scanned repository

The scanned repositories and SPDX documents will provide data to augur, namely on the risk page under any repo scanned.

Here are the steps to get it up and running:

1. Switch to the Augur-SPDX branch of Augur:
    ```
    git checkout dev-spdx-scanner
    ```

2. Run the `make` installation for Augur-SPDX under Augur's Makefile:
    ```
    make install-spdx
    ```
    
3. Ensure your augur configuration is pointing to the database you want to access and scan
    ```
    nano augur.config.json
    ```
    
4. Navigate to the folder with the Augur-SPDX executable

    ```
    cd /augur/workers/spdx_worker/
    ```
    
5. run the file `director.py`

    ```
    python3 director.py
    ```
    
The Director will provide information of what it is doing. <br />
It will scan the repositories in the Augur database, then generate SPDX documents.

Each repository can take anywhere from 10 seconds to 1 hour to scan, and SPDX Documents are usually quicker.<br />

This method is experimental!<br />

History
-------
Augur-SPDX owes its software name and concept to the
[DoSOCS](https://github.com/socs-dev-env/DoSOCS) tool created by Zac
McFarland, which in turn was spun off from the [do_spdx](https://github.com/ttgurney/yocto-spdx/blob/master/src/spdx.bbclass) plugin for Yocto
Project, created by Jake Cloyd and Liang Cao.
Augur-SPDX aims to fill the same role as DoSOCS, but with support for future versions of Augur, a
larger feature set, and a more modular implementation.
